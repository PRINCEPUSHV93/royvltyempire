    <h1>About PRINCE PUSHA</h1>
    <p><strong>Founder of ROYVLTY EMPIRE</strong>, Music Engineer, and Artist Developer based in Sarasota, FL. I've been doing music since I was young and it's more than a career — it's a calling.</p>
    <p>One pivotal moment in my journey: I mixed a song for someone not knowing who he was — he ended up being a major figure. That track caught attention and earned props from Timbaland. Since then, I've been shaping records with precision and passion.</p>
    <p>ROYVLTY EMPIRE was built because I know the struggle of being an independent artist — not just hungry for money, but for knowledge. I swore to create something for artists to get the tools I never had. </p>
    <p>With 9 years in the game and fully self-taught, I’ve worked with artists like Soulja Skip, Geno Mays, BIGG KC, Chaz OG, Ben J, King SRQ, BLOWIN BANDZ, 4MG JAYY DUBB, and more. I continue to collaborate with B-list labels and build with artists from the ground up.</p>
    <p>What makes me different? I’m not here to gatekeep. I’m for the artist. I’m for the people. If you're serious about your craft, let's build together.</p>
