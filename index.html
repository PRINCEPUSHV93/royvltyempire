  <h1>Welcome to ROYVLTY EMPIRE</h1>
  <p style="max-width: 800px; margin: 20px auto; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6;">

    At ROYVLTY EMPIRE, we offer more than we ask. With us, you're not just another client — you're family. We believe in building careers, not just hits, and guiding artists and future industry leaders through hands-on experience, industry insight, and a dedicated support system.
